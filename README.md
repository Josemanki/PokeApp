# PokeApp

Simple PokeDex-like app, made using PokeAPI and React.

## What does it offer?

- This PokeDex integrates a comfortable filtering function, working evolution trees and the ability to open any evolution from any pokemon in its chain.
- Features lazy loading in order to have a comfortable loading time for the application
- Dynamically colors each background in the Pokemon cards according to the type of the Pokemon, including mixed types, which instead creates a gradient.
